Making this file because I made the changes in a clone of this repo, then messed up the `git push` command,
then spend hours trying to fix the file history and ended up just trying to merge the branch I made,
and now I need the branch to be ahead of main so I can make a pull request.

Long story short, I messed up, and the only purpose of this file is to document my mistakes while also fixing them.
